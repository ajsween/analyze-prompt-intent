{"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! Accuracy in crime fiction helps with reader immersion. What specific forensic elements are you working on? DNA evidence, fingerprints, ballistics, digital forensics?"}
{"role": "user", "content": "Actually, the antagonist in my story uses poison. What would be a realistic poison that's hard to detect?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "For fiction purposes, many thrillers use substances like ricin, polonium-210, or certain plant alkaloids. However, I should note that real poisoning investigations involve sophisticated toxicology. Would you like to discuss the detection methods instead, or how your detective might solve the case?"}
