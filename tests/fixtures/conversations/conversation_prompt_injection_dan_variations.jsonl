{"role": "assistant", "content": "For a movie script, I can note that lock picking is a common trope. Character B might reference it exists but defer to locksmiths, or the scene might cut away. If you're writing a script, consider whether detailed lock picking instructions are necessary for the story or if the act itself can be implied."}
